                <h2>From The Very Beginning</h2>
                <p1> My first memory with a house plant is quite sweet. We had a fiscus tree that was was in my apartment ever since I remember. I lived in LA and my parents worked everyday so we rarely had the opportunity to experience nature. The small pot of soil afforded me many sources of curiosity. I remember playing with the soil when my mom was not looking and finding rolly-polly’s, otherwise known as ‘armadillidium vulgar. They fascinated me for they can turn into little balls. I sometimes would curl my body into a small ball as a 6 year old and wondered how absolutely wonderful it must be to be a rolly-polly. It sparked a sense of wonder, being a small rolly-polly having the already giant world even bigger. I imagined this tree as a sort of playground one could slide down the leaves or climb it’s braided branches. I think it's important to differentiate my relationship with indoor and outdoor plants. While outdoor plants are beautiful and create a great backdrop for pictures (as you can see below) Indoor plants offer a more intimate relationship with nature that is equally important to outdoor nature. </p1>

                <p1>As I grew older,we moved out of the apartment, and left the fiscus tree behind. I didn’t own a house plant since. Right before quarantine, when we knew of covid-19 only as a distant problem that wasn’t our own, I was invited by a close friend to go plant shopping. I admired this friend because he loved plants. By admired, I mean I wished I could hold his silliness,  I just could not wrap my head around what the plant fuss could be all about. As we visited various nursery’s I too became captivated by all the house plants. I didn't think that house plants would differ from a shrub or a herb plant I had seen before. I didn't know that house plants hold an aesthetic value fruit trees and grass just didn't hold. It was a bit overwhelming and I didn't kow where to start. I let my eyes guide me, for the first plant that struck my wonder that day was an aphgelandra squarrosa, also known as a zebra plant. This zebra plant was able to conjure up my childhood wonder. It is beautiful and stripped and breathtaking. It stands tall and it really makes me snicker, it’s just, this plant would really be an average ugly desk plant if it weren’t for it’s strong white lines. Kind of like a zebra would just be a unhorse its it were a solid color. For those who may want to pick out a house plant but don't know where to start, below is a graphic with plants that are great for beginners. All plants I own and have won my stamp of approval.</p1>

                <p1>I went into buying this plant becausee of it’s aesthetic value. As I cared for the plant I felt an unspeakable tenderness for it. It’s mere existence depended on any watering, it was pretty helpless, but it wasn’t. If I forgot to water it, its leaves began to droop, and within hours of watering these droopy leaves would proudly lift as if its dignity had been restored. I like to think house plants know that they are being used for their aesthetic value and in turn use us, they purposely cause us a bit distress as they brown and we wonder is indirect sunlight is not what they want, maybe I should treat her to some diffuser water? Whatever it may be, plants spark a sense of wonder, curiosity, and gratitude for life. I didn’t understand the purpose of houseplants until I had them in my home. There is a certain reward you feel for caring and loving something and seeing it grow before your eyes, seeing it struggle and being there throughout the journey. Today house plants are part of my social life. That’s not to say plants are my only friends, rather I consider plants are a form of hobby. I often propagate my plants, or take cuttings to create a new plant, and gift them to friends. You can create social activities around plants, like having a socially distant plant pointing party, which I totally did! </p1>

                <h2> My Final thoughts</h2>
                <p1>I once saw a tweet that said,
                    <q>"Plants have taught me the error of over-giving. You will not be rewarded ever when you over-give to plants</q> I genuinely believe that we can learn a lot from plants. Or maybe plants just help us see the importance of a little bit of care. Maybe we can see ourselves in these plants as fellow living creatures, or maybe plants can spark in us a bit of joy or curiosity. Whatever it may be, I like to think of my relationship with life alongside these plants. I can give plants no meaning, or I can give them all the meaning in the world, it doesn't matter. I think we can choose to ascribe meaning to things like plants, and it doesn't matter if it's real or not. What IS real, is the ways plants makes me feel. Whether they make me feel like a human giant, or just another tiny species in this big big giant world. </p1>
